TeacHingChain-Java

A very simple implementation of a rudimentary blockchain for illustrative/teaching purposes in Java 

Build is stable but **LOCAL ONLY** the websocket integration for block/tx transport is not yet working

This means you can only run it as essentially a 'private blockchain' at this time

If you wish to run a local instance of the project, use the GenesisBuilder in the GenesisBuilder-Java repository ,,,

to generate a genesis block and fill in the appropriate fields in 'GenesisBlock.java'

More detailed information/instruction on the project is coming soon!
