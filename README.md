TeacHingChain-Java

A very simple implementation of a rudimentary blockchain for illustrative/teaching purposes in Java 

Build is stable but **LOCAL ONLY** the websocket integration for block/tx transport is not yet working

This means you can only run it as essentially a 'private blockchain' at this time

More detailed information of the project is coming soon!
